Dear Friend,

Having viewed your status on-line which motivated me that you can be a
trusted person,i am contacting you in respect to my late husband s fund
worth US 20Million deposited with ATLANTIQUE BANK BENIN REPUBLIC,for safe
keeping purposes.But right now my husband is dead and the financial firm
has been giving me several notifications to make the claim of the said
deposit. I want a situation whereby i will present you as my Executor to
the bank so that you assist me to make the claim of this fund from the
financial firm so that it will be transferred to your custody pending my
arrival with my only daughter to your country so that we can use it
judiciously for investment purposes.

My only daughter will continue her education in your country upon our
arrival once every arrangement as regards this transaction is concluded.I
will be offering you
20% of the fund for your foreign assistance as long as you can help me out
in carrying out this project effectively without insinuating greed and
selfishness. I am
contacting you in this respect for the below purposes,

1,To avoid awareness of my late husbands relatives because they would like
to inherit it alone if i dare disclose it to them because they said that i
do not have a

male child for my late husband without considering the welfare of me and my
only daughter.

2,To avoid awareness of Benin Republic Government about the fund since my
husband was a former politician in Benin. Once i receive your positive
response,i will give you more details as to enable us proceed


Yours sincerely
Mrs Pecuma Delotu
